Given the growing political, social and economic crisis as well as the lack of guarantees for a peaceful resolution, it is important to understand how Ecuadorians behave during protests. An analysis of the AmericasBarometer public opinion survey reveals that those who participate in protests are more likely to be men, to respect the right to protest in general, to disapprove of the President’s management and to identify with a political group. Notably, the survey results suggest that those who self-identify as indigenous, whose economic situation has worsened, and who are unemployed are not more likely to participate in protests. It is also discovered that respect for the right to protest moves against support for the current President, revealing a worrying situation: the Ecuadorian might only respect this right when the protests align with their political interests.\nJuly 2022- January 2023 Issue\nISSN 2953-6456"

    "text": "Protest Participation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn mid-June 2022, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) called for a massive mobilization in the country in order for President Guillermo Lasso to include ten economic and social demands in his government plan [1]. After 18 days of demonstrations, the strike ended following an agreement between the national government and CONAIE [2]. The demonstrations left Ecuador with nine deaths, millions of dollars in damages and economic losses, as well as several injured and apprehended by the police [3–5].\nEcuador seems to have lost the relative political stability it had during Rafael Correa’s ten years in government, especially considering the historic protest of October 2019, also led by CONAIE against the government of then-President Lenín Moreno [6]. However, periods of stability in our country have been the exception rather than the norm. Historically, Ecuador has had a coup d’etat every 6 years, and 50% of these were successful in overthrowing the current government [7].\nThe Barometer of the Americas (AB) survey by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) has conducted several public opinion polls in Ecuador since 2004, including a series of questions on protests since 2006. The last time these questions were asked was at the beginning of 2019, which allows us to observe public opinion just before the October 2019 protest, where CONAIE and other organizations also called for mobilizations against then-President Lenín Moreno.\nThe above chart shows that in 2006, around 21.57% of respondents reported attending a protest in the last 12 months —likely due to the “Rebellion of the Outlaws” that overthrew President Lucio Gutierrez—. From that year on, the percentage of participation gradually decreases in the country, culminating at the beginning of 2019 with 7.66%. In the summer of 2015, there were significant mobilizations called by CONAIE and opposition politicians against the government of Rafael Correa [8,9]. However, the demonstrations seem to have not mobilized as many people, even though they coincided with the lowest popularity of the then-president’s regime [10]."

    "section": "Characteristics of protesters",
    "text": "Characteristics of protesters\nEcuadorian protestors have historically been predominantly male, except in 2014 and 2019 where there were no statistically significant differences between men and women. Those who protest are more likely to be affiliated with a political group1 and to disapprove of the president’s performance. While protestors are generally younger and more educated than those who do not protest, the difference is almost negligible - contrary to what one might think.\nAre those who take to the streets poorer than those who do not protest? No. In fact, only 38% of those who protest consider that their economic situation is worse than 12 months ago. This percentage is only slightly higher than the percentage of non-protesters who consider that their situation has worsened. Similarly, the historical unemployment rate 2 of protesters is not statistically different from the global unemployment rate of the sample -except in 2014, where there is a ten percentage point difference-.”\nA key detail about protesters is their racial composition, and survey data shows that there are no statistically significant differences between the historical percentages of indigenous protesters and non-protesters. In fact, the percentage of indigenous people among all protesters is close to only 6% historically from 2006 to 2019. This low figure may be underestimated as not many surveys are conducted in rural cantons, where the indigenous population is concentrated. However, it makes sense to think that the actual figure should not deviate much from the one presented here: since indigenous people are a minority of the country’s population3, it is likely that they also constitute a minority among those who participate in protests. On the other hand, there is a statistically significant difference in protest participation regarding the percentage of people who self-identify as white, as it is less likely for them to protest."

    "section": "Participation in protests vs. support for the right to protest",
    "text": "Participation in protests vs. support for the right to protest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is relevant to consider a key difference that may have been easily confused lately, especially while the protests were taking place: participation in protests is not the same as approval of them. LAPOP’s AmericasBarometer allows to construct a time series to monitor Ecuadorians’ historical support for protests, as seen below.\nThe data shows us that prior to the 2019 protest, the right to protest both in general and by opposition groups has been approved by the majority of the voting age population, except in 2012 and 2014. Initially, more Ecuadorians support protests in general than protests by groups against the current government4. However, the relationship reversed for 2016, near the end of Correa’s government, where it was more likely for a person to approve protests against the current government than protests in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne fact that stands out is that the period of lower tolerance to protest occurred during the peak of popularity of Rafael Correa’s government, as can be seen in the graph on the right. In periods where the president was popular, there was greater rejection of protest while in periods where the president was less popular there was more approval of protest. Since Lenín Moreno distanced himself from the old regime, there is again a greater tolerance for protest. We should not infer causality of correlation alone, however, these facts open the door to a possible explanation of protests at convenience. That is to say, protests are valid and legitimate when they align with my interests and political tendencies, but if not? are they not valid?\n\n\nTable 1: Approval of the right to protest by participation in protests in the last 12 months\n\n\n\n\n(a) Protesting in general\n\n\nHas participated in a protest\nApproves\nDoes not approve\n\n\n\n\nYes\n74%\n26%\n\n\nNo\n57%\n43%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Protesting against the government\n\n\nHas participated in a protest\nApproves\nDoes not approve\n\n\n\n\nSí\n62%\n38%\n\n\nNo\n55%\n45%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows the historical percentage of two types of approval of protests ranked by participation in protests. As would be expected, a protester is more likely to approve of the right to protest than someone who has not protested. However, those who participate in protests would also be expected to broadly approve of the right to protest in any setting, but there are 26% who have not historically approved of it. Regarding support for protests by groups opposed to the government, the percentages are worse: historically 38% of protesters do not approve of that right. This is a strange and worrisome phenomenon that deserves to be looked at more closely in the future, with updated data."

    "section": "Some implications",
    "text": "Some implications\nThe analysis can be summarized in the following points:\n\nProtesters tend to approve of the right to protest (although not as much), identify with some political wing (right, left, or center), and disapprove of the president’s job. Female and white protestors are less likely to be found.\nThere are no significant differences between protestors and non-protestors in terms of age, years of schooling, the probability of being indigenous, being unemployed and having a worse economic situation.\nA clear divergence is found between participation in protests and approval of protests, with the percentage of approval always being much higher than that of participation.\nInterestingly, approval of protests moves against support for the incumbent president. The more popular the government, the less respected the right to protest.\n\nIt is necessary to understand what the protests imply, both for those who lead and face them and for ordinary citizens. In my opinion, it is even more important for the average Ecuadorian to understand them, since they are the ones who are usually in the front line of the demonstrations, as opposed to the politicians, leaders and authorities who lead them. State violence towards social protest is not justifiable, as well as the minimization of the problems that afflict indigenous communities5, but violence by protesters cannot be justified either. Informing our discussion about the conjuncture of the country with facts, free of ideology and subjectivity, is extremely imperative to move towards a better nation, avoiding violence and social polarization as well as protecting the right to peaceful protest, key to the proper functioning of a democracy [12].\nThe June 2022 protests end with concessions from both sides, which unfortunately only revolve around the price of gasoline, postponing to the medium term the resolution of the other problems such as obtaining fair prices for agricultural producers and the management of the insecurity crisis. History threatens to repeat itself at this dialogue table, remembering that in 2019 the protests ended by a stabilization of the price of gasoline although the actors involved were unable to reach an agreement [6]. Our country cannot put up with more violence between protesters and authorities every two years; social actors must strive for Ecuador to be just that: a country, and not a blender[^5] to which you give something whole and it gives it back to you crushed. We must demand from the rest and demand from ourselves the strength to build a country of peace and prosperity, but also a country of peaceful and effective change when it is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis post was proudly conceived with Quarto and R using RStudio, originally published in El Quantificador from Laboratorio de Investigación para el Desarrollo del Ecuador (LIDE).

De forma decepcionante (aunque quizás no sorprendente), no existe una autoridad que provea datos oficiales de la LigaPro Ecuador. Existen algunas páginas web que proveen datos básicos, con especial atención al esfuerzo de @mifutbolecuador, sin embargo, no es posible encontrar una fuente que permita descargas. Curiosamente, sucede lo mismo para los campeonatos internacionales CONMEBOL: aunque existe más información disponible, es complicado llegar a una base de datos limpia y descargable. Esto quizás se debe al potencial uso monetario de estos datos dada la existencia de la industria de las apuestas deportivas (especialmente importante en Ecuador).\nVentajosamente, existen esfuerzos internacionales que recientemente han empezado a recopilar información sobre equipos ecuatorianos. Uno es FBref.com, un sitio web que provee datos de fútbol de todo el mundo. Otro sitio web similar es Transfermarkt. La información de ambos sitios web es de libre acceso, aunque no es posible descargar los datos directamente desde la página web. Sin embargo, su existencia que permiten una técnica común de recolección de datos: web scraping. El scraping puede ser un problema por varias razones, ya que requiere entender las estructuras de datos de la página web para construir un códgio de scraping robusto. Ventajosamente, R ofrece un atajo excelente: la librería worldfootballR de @JaseZiv, que permite hacer scraping de forma fácil automática. Arriba utilicé esta librería para acceder a datos pre-procesados de FBref para todos los partidos de Copa Libertadores1 y Sudamericana2 desde 2014 hasta 20233.\nCode\n# Grafico de resultados LDU en campeonatos internacionales\n\ncolors &lt;- c('Libertadores'= '#C7B143', 'Sudamericana' = '#20409A')\n\ninternational_results_ldu  %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt; 2014) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year, stage_reached, fill = tournament)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.8, position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2014, 2023, 1)) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2015.2, y = 3.4, label = 'Octavos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2015.8, y = 1, label = 'Grupos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2017.2, y = 3.4, label = 'Octavos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2018.2, y = 3.4, label = 'Octavos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2018.8, y = 6, label = 'Cuartos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2019.8, y = 3.4, label = 'Octavos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2020.8, y = 1, label = 'Grupos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2021.2, y = 6, label = 'Cuartos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2022.2, y = 1, label = 'Grupos', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  annotate('text', x = 2023.2, y = 10, label = 'Final', size = 12, color = 'white', angle = 90) +\n  labs(x = '',\n       y = '',\n       title = 'Resultados de copas internacionales para Liga de Quito',\n       subtitle = 'Copa Libertadores y Copa Sudamericana, 2015-2023',\n       fill = 'Campeonato',\n       caption = 'Nota: Valores sin etiqueta se presentan cuando LDU no participó en el campeonato.')+\n  theme_daniel+\n  theme(axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = c(0.08, 0.88))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave('grafico-resultados.png', width = 6, height = 6, dpi = 300)\nNaturalmente, a Liga le ha costado más terminar en etapas avanzadas de Copa Libertadores que de Copa Sudamericana. El salto a la final de la Copa Sudamericana se da de forma abrupta: en 2022 no logra pasar de la etapa de grupos, pero en 2023 arrasa y llega a la final en Montevideo para enfrentarse a Fortaleza de Brasil, un equipo relativamente nuevo en la escena internacional al haber recientemente ascendido a la primera división de Brasil.\nUna de las complicaciones de los datos (tanto en FBref como en Transfermarkt) es que el gráfico solamente muestra una escena parcial de la historia de LDU en campeonatos internacionales. Lo más lejos que se puede observar es el resultado de Sudamericana en 2015, en donde Liga cayó ante River Plate tras un recordado penal errado por Jonathan Álvez, con Liga como anfitrión. No es posible observar los datos de la mítica Liga de los 2000, que ganó la Copa Libertadores y Sudamericana en 2008 y 2009 además de dos Recopas4 en 2009 y 2010. Tampoco es posible observar el periodo posterior a 2010, en donde Liga de Quito no logró clasificar a ningún torneo internacional hasta 2015.\nCode\n# Extraer datos de partidos de Sudamericana para obtener Top Rivales de Liga en Sudamericana\n\nsudamericana_matches_ldu &lt;-\n  sudamericana_matches %&gt;% \n  filter(home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' | away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito') %&gt;% \n  transmute(year,\n            round,\n            date,\n            ldu_home_or_away = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ 'Home',\n              away_team_name== 'LDU de Quito' ~ 'Away'),\n            opponent = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_team_name,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_team_name),\n            opponent_country = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_team_country,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_team_country),\n            ldu_goals = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_goals,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_goals),\n            opponent_goals = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_goals,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_goals),\n            ldu_result = case_when(\n              ldu_goals &gt; opponent_goals ~ 'Win',\n              ldu_goals &lt; opponent_goals ~ 'Loss',\n              ldu_goals == opponent_goals ~ 'Draw'),\n            tournament = 'Sudamericana',\n            )\n\n# Hacer lo mismo para Libertadores\n\nlibertadores_matches_ldu &lt;-\n  libertadores_matches %&gt;% \n  filter(home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' | away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito') %&gt;% \n  transmute(year,\n            round,\n            date,\n            ldu_home_or_away = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ 'Home',\n              away_team_name== 'LDU de Quito' ~ 'Away'),\n            opponent = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_team_name,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_team_name),\n            opponent_country = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_team_country,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_team_country),\n            ldu_goals = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_goals,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_goals),\n            opponent_goals = case_when(\n              home_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ away_goals,\n              away_team_name == 'LDU de Quito' ~ home_goals),\n            ldu_result = case_when(\n              ldu_goals &gt; opponent_goals ~ 'Win',\n              ldu_goals &lt; opponent_goals ~ 'Loss',\n              ldu_goals == opponent_goals ~ 'Draw'),\n            tournament = 'Libertadores')\n\n# Unir dataframes y obtener totales de goles a favor y en contra para cada año y por cada torneo\n\nldu_match_goals &lt;-\n  bind_rows(sudamericana_matches_ldu, libertadores_matches_ldu) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, tournament) %&gt;% \n  summarise(ldu_goals = sum(ldu_goals, na.rm = TRUE),\n            opponent_goals = sum(opponent_goals, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ldu_wins = sum(ldu_result == 'Win', na.rm = TRUE),\n            ldu_losses = sum(ldu_result == 'Loss', na.rm = TRUE),\n            ldu_draws = sum(ldu_result == 'Draw', na.rm = TRUE),\n            total_matches = n()) %&gt;% \n  mutate(ldu_goal_difference = ldu_goals - opponent_goals,\n         ldu_win_percentage = ldu_wins / total_matches * 100) %&gt;% \n  arrange(year, tournament) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\n# Graficar \n\nldu_match_goals %&gt;% \n  select(year, tournament, ldu_goals, opponent_goals) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(ldu_goals, opponent_goals),\n               names_to = 'goals_from',\n               values_to = 'goals') %&gt;%\n  mutate(goals_from = case_when(\n    goals_from == 'ldu_goals' ~ 'A favor',\n    goals_from == 'opponent_goals' ~ 'En contra')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = goals, fill = goals_from)) +\n  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2015, 2023, 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#20409A', '#EE2E24')) +\n  facet_wrap(~tournament) +\n  labs(title = 'Goles a favor y en contra de LDU',\n       subtitle = 'Torneos internacionales 2015-2023',\n       x = '',\n       y = 'Goles',\n       fill = '',\n       caption = str_wrap('Nota: se presentan goles a favor y en contra solo en casos en donde LDU clasificó y participó en al menos en un partido.

Naturalmente, el equipo ha mejorado su ratio de goles a medida que ha ido pasando a etapas más avanzadas del torneo y como es de esperarse, Liga es más capaz de mantener su arco en cero en la Sudamericana que en la Libertadores. El mejor desempeño de LDU en la Sudamericana se da este año, con 23 goles en 14 partidos, lo que representa un 50% de partidos ganados. Esto, sin embargo, no es el mejor record de LDU en torneos internacionales de los últimos años: en 2020, aunque el equipo solo pasó a octavos de final, logró un 62.5% de partidos ganados en Copa Libertadores. Esto es un claro ejemplo de cómo la estadística simple no debería ser malinterpretada en contextos deportivos como este.\nSin embargo, hay indicadores que rara vez fallan, y uno de ellos es $ la plata $. ¿Cuánto invirtió Liga de Quito en los últimos años para llegar donde está el día de hoy? Esta pregunta podría parecer extremadamente complicada de responder, pero los datos de Transfermarkt, plataforma alemana conocida por su exactitud en cuanto a información de traspasos y valor de jugadores, lo facilita. La función que permite obtener esta información permite solamente observar un año a la vez, por lo que utilizo un for loop (aunque muy temidos en R, los loops son manejables) para obtener la información de los últimos años sin tener que llamar la función una y otra vez.\nCode\n# El campeonato ecuatoriano está distribuido en dos diferentes links de Transfermarkt, es necesario crear un foroop para cada uno: \n\n# Vector de años para el loop (2019-2022)\n\nyears_1 &lt;- 2019:2023\n\n# Inicializar una lista para guardar los resultados de cada iteracion del loop\n\necuador_finances1 &lt;- list()\n\nfor (i in years_1){\n  ecuador_finances1[[which(years_1 == i)]] &lt;- tm_team_transfer_balances('ECU', \n                                                                     i, \n                                                                     league_url = 'https://www.transfermarkt.com/ligapro-serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/EL1A') %&gt;% \n    mutate(year = i) # Agregar año para cada iteracion\n}\n\n# El siguiente loop requiere tanto el link como el año, definir los vectores a continuacion\n\n# Siguiente link: 2012-2018\n\nyears_2 &lt;- 2012:2018\n\nlinks &lt;- c(\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2011',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2012',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2013',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2014',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2015',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2016',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2017',\n  'https://www.transfermarkt.com/serie-a-primera-etapa/startseite/wettbewerb/ECPE/plus/?saison_id=2018'\n)\n\necuador_finances2 &lt;- list()\n\nfor (i in 1:length(years_2)){\n ecuador_finances2[[years_2[i]]] &lt;- tm_team_transfer_balances('ECU', years_2[i], league_url = links[i]) %&gt;% \n                                    mutate(year = years_2[i]) \n}\n\n# Extraer informacion a un dataframe y limpiar datos:\n\necuador_finances_full &lt;-\n  bind_rows(ecuador_finances1, ecuador_finances2) \n\n# Filtrar para solo LDU, calcular ingresos-egresos y graficar en un grafico de barras\n\necuador_finances_full %&gt;% \n  filter(squad == 'LDU Quito') %&gt;% \n  transmute(year, \n            income = income_euros, \n            expenditure = -expenditure_euros) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(c(income, expenditure),\n               names_to = 'balance_type',\n               values_to = 'values') %&gt;% \n  mutate(balance_type = if_else(balance_type == 'income', 'Ingresos', 'Egresos')) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(as.factor(year), values/1000000, fill = balance_type, group = balance_type)) + \n  geom_col(position = 'dodge')+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('Ingresos' = '#20409A', 'Egresos' = '#EE2E24')) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 6, by = 2)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'gray40', linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = 'Ingresos y egresos para Liga de Quito',\n       subtitle = 'Cifras de traspasos 2012-2022',\n       x = '',\n       y = 'Miles de euros',\n       fill = '',\n       caption = str_wrap('Nota: 2023 es un año parcial.

De forma notable, el club vendió a dos jugadores por altos valores: Rodrigo Aguirre y Nilson Angulo, por 4.75 y 1.90 millones de euros. En 2022 LDU no invirtió dinero en su plantilla, sin embargo, logró traer al equipo a varios agentes libres, situación que no se refleja en el gráfico anterior, pero se puede visualizar en la página web de Transfermarkt. Uno de los jugadores más importantes que llega a LDU como agente libre es Alexander Domínguez, histórico arquero de la selección ecuatoriana y LDU, que regresa al equipo luego de varios años en el exterior. Adicionalmente, las cifras no muestran los valores de contratos temporales, como es el de Renato Ibarra, mediocampista ecuatoriano, quien llega a LDU tras una larga carrera en el fútbol internacional. De todas formas, la inversión en la plantilla de 2021 es la tercera más alta de los últimos 20 años, y los ingresos que LDU ha podido recolectar en 2022 y 2023 potencialmente le permitirán seguir invirtiendo en su plantel existente, así como en la infraestructura del club y las juveniles, que son lo que inicialmente hicieron al club lo que es hoy (y lo que ahora diferencia a Independiente del Valle, también muy exitoso equipo ecuatoriano).\nLejos de ser un ejercicio exhaustivo de análisis, lo que este post intenta hacer es dar una mirada aterrizada a las cifras del equipo en los dos torneos más importantes de la región. Es desafortunado que no exista una fuente de datos centralizada que permita analizar el fútbol ecuatoriano y regional más a fondo, sin embargo, las posibilidades que ofrecen los desarrolladores open source de R, como el paquete utilizado aquí, worldfootballR, son una muestra de que es posible hacer análisis de datos de fútbol de forma más accesible y transparente. Espero que este trabajo sea de utilidad para quiénes se interesen en extraer y analizar datos de fútbol latinoamericano en gran escala, y, ante todo, que sea un buen augurio para la quinta estrella del trono en Ponceano."

    "text": "What makes Epica different?\nEpica is unique. Though that is something that any die-hard fan will tell you, Epica has several factors which make them stand out in the genre. Most importantly, they combine gutural growls from death metal with female soprano vocals and string orchestras. Epica started this particular style on The Phantom Agony, after Dutch guitarist and singer Mark Jansen left After Forever and founded the band with Dutch singer Simone Simons.\nTo look at how Epica has constructed its musical features, we can use Spotify-computed audio features, which rank songs based on energy, danceability, valence, among others [1]. The Spotify API can be accessed with R through the spotifyr package, but it needs users to create a Spotify Developer account and request a Client ID and a Client Secret. For a comprehensive tutorial on how to do this, go here.\nWith the credentials, set them up as system environment variables through a call to Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'something') and Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= 'something'). Further, since we’re going to access data from Epica, it’s useful to set up the Spotify identificator for the band, which can be found in the Spotify artist’s link, after the artist/ and before the interrogation sign ?. With that, we can acquire all albums from Epica available in Spotify, as well as audio metrics per track. The data requires quite a bit of preparation for ggplot2 graphics, but trust me, it’s worth it. Below, I acquire track-level audio metrics and then group at the album level1 by taking averages of all metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can display the code which generated the graphs using the little down arrow in the code blocks.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Setup the access token\n\naccess_token &lt;- get_spotify_access_token(client_id = Sys.getenv('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID'),\n                                         client_secret = Sys.getenv('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET'))\n\n# Define an album/EPs vector, a year vector, to use later as well as the artist id\n\nepica_spotify_id &lt;- '5HA5aLY3jJV7eimXWkRBBp'\n\nepica_releases_year &lt;- \n  data.frame(\n    release_spotify = c(\"The Phantom Agony (Expanded Edition)\", \n                        \"Consign To Oblivion (Expanded Edition)\", \n                        \"The Divine Conspiracy\", \n                        \"Design Your Universe\", \n                        \"Requiem for the Indifferent\", \n                        \"The Quantum Enigma\", \n                        \"The Holographic Principle\",\n                        \"The Solace System\", \n                        \"Omega\", \n                        \"The Alchemy Project\"),\n    release_name =  c(\"The Phantom Agony\", \n                      \"Consign To Oblivion\", \n                      \"The Divine Conspiracy\",\n                      \"Design Your Universe\", \n                      \"Requiem for the Indifferent\", \n                      \"The Quantum Enigma\",\n                      \"The Holographic Principle\",\n                      \"The Solace System\", \n                      \"Omega\", \n                      \"The Alchemy Project\"),\n    release_year = c(2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, 2022)\n)  %&gt;% \nmutate(release_name_year = paste(release_name,' ', '(', release_year, ')', sep = ''))\n\n# Get metrics at the track level and filter for the selection of releases I chose\n\nepica_track_metrics &lt;-\n  get_artist_audio_features(epica_spotify_id, include_groups = c('album', 'single')) %&gt;%\n  select(track_name,\n         album_name,\n         album_id,\n         energy,\n         loudness,\n         speechiness,\n         acousticness,\n         instrumentalness,\n         liveness,\n         valence,\n         tempo) %&gt;% \n  filter(album_name %in% epica_releases_year$release_spotify) \n\n# Group at the album level, reshape to long form, then plot\n\nepica_album_metrics &lt;-\n  epica_track_metrics %&gt;% \n  group_by(album_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise_if(is.numeric, mean) %&gt;% \n  left_join(epica_releases_year, by = c('album_name' = 'release_spotify')) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(release_year)) %&gt;% \n  select(-album_name) %&gt;% \n  mutate(loudness = abs(loudness)) %&gt;% \n  relocate(release_name, release_name_year, release_year) %&gt;% \n  gather(metric, value, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo)\n\n# Create an ordering for my metrics\n\norderings &lt;- \n  data.frame(\n    metric = c('energy', 'valence', 'instrumentalness', 'speechiness'),\n    order = c(4,3,2,1)\n  )\n\n# Graph\n\nepica_album_metrics %&gt;%\n  filter(metric %in% c('energy', 'valence', 'instrumentalness', 'speechiness')) %&gt;% \n  left_join(orderings, by = 'metric') %&gt;% \n  mutate(metric = factor(str_to_sentence(metric))) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(reorder(release_name_year, release_year), value, fill = reorder(metric, order))) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7, position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title = 'The Sound of Epica 2000-2023',\n    subtitle = \"Spotify audio metrics for all Epica albums & EPs \\n\",\n     y = '',\n     x = '',\n     caption = str_wrap('Note: Spotify provides audio metrics at the track level.

Cry for the Moon remains as one of Epica’s most important tracks, as it set the scene for the what was to come later. Curiously, this first album is not the most instrumental of them all, ranking fourth in terms of instrumentalness according to Spotify. The most instrumental release by Epica is actually Consign to Oblivion (2005), often considered as the band’s magnum opus, followed by 2016’s The Holographic Principle. The data show an apparent trade-off between energy and instrumentality, an intuitive idea which is only challenged by the unique Design Your Universe (2009) with high instrumentality and energy. This last release contained the unforgettable Unleashed, probably Epica’s most mainstream track to date.\nSomewhat of a pattern can be found in the band’s last two releases: the instrumentality fades, apparently in favour of more energy. Is this the way that Epica makes its way into today’s hyper competitive and commercial music industry? A question like this has no clear answer (and perhaps does not deserve one), but the strategy here might be one of making a subtle impact. With newer releases which are friendler to the unexperienced listeners, Epica subtly enters the scene to the create an obsessive devotion after the innocent streamer turns to mindless fanatic after listening to the band’s more loyal records of old."

    "section": "Sentiment analysis",
    "text": "Sentiment analysis\nA painful truth about metal (at least in Latin America) is that it often faces resistance from people who relate the genre to negativeness. When Marilyn Manson visited Mexico in 2003, for instance, Christian organizations held prayer sessions to “counter the satanist effects of the artist”6. Though Epica has not faced these types of accusations, for many people it would still fall under the broad spectrum of metal, which is supposed to be charged with negative energy. How true is this?\nIt is possible to attempt an answer to this question through sentiment analysis. In a nutshell, one uses dictionaries or lexicons which contain thousands of words along with a connotation (could be negative, energetic, etc.) to compare with the text of choice. Below, I use the Bing lexicon to categorize The Phantom Agony’s lyrics into either positive or negative.\n\n\nCode\nbing_lexicon &lt;-\n  get_sentiments('bing')\n\nbing_wordcount &lt;-\n  phantom_agony_wordcount %&gt;% \n  inner_join(bing_lexicon, by = 'word') %&gt;%\n  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(freq)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n  \nbing_wordcount %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(reorder(word, freq), freq, fill = sentiment)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = 'free_y') +\n  geom_text(aes(label = freq), \n            size = 12,\n            color = 'gray',\n            hjust = -1) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = '',\n       x = '',\n       title = \"The Phantom Agony's Sentiment Analysis\",\n       subtitle = 'Using the Bing lexicon to classify words into a positive/negative dichotomy\\n',\n       caption = str_wrap(\"Note: Includes word counts of The Phantom Agony. Lyrics data obtained from the Genius API through the geniusr package. Tokenization of the text performed with the tidytext package. Sentiment analysis used the Bing lexicon from the tidytext package.\", 116)) +\n  guides(fill = 'none') +\n  geom_text(aes(label = freq), colour = 'gray', hjust = 0.5) +\n  theme_daniel +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = 'grey', hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis initial analysis shows that the top words in the album are indeed categorised as negative, and in fact over 70% of the album’s words are so negative. It is important to understand that this type of sentiment analysis does not perform well with complicated semantic constructions, such as sarcasm or metaphors. For instance, if a song were to constantly mention suffering, but the song is about getting over suffering to reach happiness, the bing lexicon would still consider the song as negative. The stringent dichotomy of positive-negatively is structurally flawed; a word’s connotation is not independent from its context. To partially solve this, there are other lexicons, the Loughran being one that has more than just positive or negative dimensions. I apply this lexicon to the band’s lyrics below:\n\n\nCode\nnrc &lt;- get_sentiments('nrc') \n\nepica_tokenised &lt;-\n  epica_all_words %&gt;%  \n  unnest_tokens(input = line,\n                output = word) %&gt;% \n  inner_join(epica_all_song_dfs %&gt;% select(song_id, album_name), \n             by = 'song_id') %&gt;% \n  anti_join(stop_words, by = 'word') %&gt;%\n  inner_join(nrc, by = 'word')\n\nepica_nrc_tpa &lt;-\n  epica_tokenised %&gt;% \n  filter(album_name == 'The Phantom Agony') %&gt;% \n  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;% \n  summarise(freq = n()) %&gt;% \n  mutate(type = 'The Phantom Agony')\n\nepica_nrc_all_but_tpa &lt;-\n  epica_tokenised %&gt;% \n  filter(album_name != 'The Phantom Agony') %&gt;% \n  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;% \n  summarise(freq = n()) %&gt;% \n  mutate(type = 'Rest of discography')\n\nepica_nrc_counts &lt;-\n  epica_nrc_tpa %&gt;% \n  bind_rows(epica_nrc_all_but_tpa)\n\nepica_nrc_counts %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(reorder(sentiment, freq), freq, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(position = 'stack')+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = '',\n       y = '',\n       title = \"Sentiment Analysis of all Epica's discography\",\n       subtitle = \"Using the NRC lexicon to augment Epica's sentiment analysis\",\n       caption = str_wrap(\"Note: Includes word counts of The Phantom Agony. Lyrics data obtained from the Genius API through the geniusr package. Tokenization of the text performed with the tidytext package. Sentiment analysis used the NRC lexicon from the tidytext package.\", 116)) +\n  guides(fill = 'none') +\n  theme_daniel +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = 'top',\n        legend.justification = c(-0.25, 0))\n\n\n\n\n\nAha! A lexicon which is able to categorise sentiments in a richer manner finds that while Epica is predominantly “negative”, “positive” words are the second most common. Note that the NRC lexicon could categorise a word in two different sentiments, so this graph is counting matches of the words with the lexicon rather than unique word counts themselves: the words in sadness, anger and disgust are already contained in the negative sentiment, for instance.\nWhile the argument against nosy relatives judging the young metalhead is far from over, the data here shows two things. The richer the lexicon, the richer the conclusions that can be obtained. Having a binary approach is not useful. Second, and probably most important: lexicons kind of suck with music, as they expect literal meanings only. The few conclusions that could be extracted from sentiment analysis have to be carefully vetted through a thorough, qualitative-ish analysis."

Dada la creciente crisis política, social y económica así como la falta de garantías para una resolución pacífica, es importante comprender la manera en la que los ecuatorianos se comportan frente a las protestas. Un análisis de la encuesta de opinión pública del Barómetro de las Américas descubre que quienes participan en protestas son más propensos a ser hombres, a respetar el derecho a la protesta en general, a desaprobar la gestión del Presidente y a identificarse con algún grupo político. Notablemente, los resultados de la encuesta sugieren que quienes se autoidentifican como indígenas, quienes cuya situación económica ha empeorado y quienes están desempleados no son más propensos a participar en protestas. También se descubre que el respecto al derecho a protestar se mueve en contra al apoyo al Presidente de turno, lo que revela una preocupante situación: el ecuatoriano podría solo respetar este derecho cuando las movilizaciones se alinean a sus intereses políticos.\nEdición Julio 2022- Enero 2023\nISSN 2953-6456"

    "text": "La participación en protestas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mediados de junio 2022, la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) convocó a una movilización masiva en el país con el fin de que el presidente Guillermo Lasso incluya dentro de su plan de gobierno diez pedidos de índole económica y social [1]. Después de 18 días de manifestaciones, el paro terminó tras un acuerdo entre el gobierno nacional y la CONAIE [2]. Las manifestaciones dejan al Ecuador con nueve muertos, millones de dólares en daños y pérdidas económicas así como varios heridos y aprehendidos por la policía [3–5].\nEl Ecuador parece haber perdido la relativa estabilidad política que tuvo durante los diez años de gobierno de Rafael Correa, especialmente considerando la protesta histórica de octubre 2019, también liderada por la CONAIE contra el gobierno del entonces presidente Lenín Moreno [6]. Sin embargo, en nuestro país los períodos de estabilidad han sido la excepción y no la norma. Históricamente Ecuador ha tenido un golpe de estado cada 6 años y un 50% de éstos fueron exitosos derrocando al gobierno de turno [7].\nLa encuesta del Barómetro de las Américas (AB) del Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) ha llevado a cabo varios sondeos de opinión pública en Ecuador desde el 2004, incluyendo una batería de preguntas sobre protestas desde 2006. La última vez que se realizaron estas preguntas fue a inicios del 2019, lo que nos permite observar la opinión pública poco antes de la protesta de octubre 2019, en donde la CONAIE y otras organizaciones también convocaron movilizaciones en contra del entonces presidente Lenín Moreno.\nEl gráfico de arriba nos muestra que en el 2006 cerca del 21.57% de los encuestados reportaron haber asistido a una protesta en los últimos 12 meses —probablemente por la “Rebelión de los Forajidos” que derrocó al Presidente Lucio Gutiérrez—. A partir de ese año, el porcentaje de participación decrece gradualmente en el país, culminando a comienzos del 2019 con un 7.66%. En verano del 2015 hubo importantes movilizaciones convocadas por la CONAIE y políticos de la oposición contra el gobierno de Rafael Correa [8,9]. Sin embargo, las manifestaciones parecen no haber convocado a tantas personas, aún cuando éstas coincidieron con la más baja popularidad del régimen del entonces presidente [10]."

    "text": "Características de los protestantes\n¿Qué caracteriza a los manifestantes ecuatorianos? A lo largo del tiempo éstos han sido mayoritariamente hombres, excepto en el 2014 y 2019, en donde no existen diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre hombres y mujeres. Es más probable que quienes protesten estén identificados con algún grupo político 1 y no aprueben la gestión del presidente. Aunque los protestantes, en general, son más jóvenes y más educados que quienes no protestan, la diferencia es casi negligible- contrario a lo que se pensaría-.\n¿Son quienes salen a las calles más pobres que quienes no protestan? No. De hecho, apenas el 38% de quienes protestan consideran que su situación económica es peor que la de hace 12 meses. Este porcentaje es solo levemente mayor al porcentaje de no protestantes que consideran que su situación ha empeorado. De igual manera, la tasa histórica de desempleo 2 de los protestantes no es estadísticamente diferente a la tasa de desempleo global de la muestra -salvo en 2014, donde sí existe una diferencia de diez puntos porcentuales-.\nUn detalle clave sobre los protestantes es su composición racial y los datos de la encuesta permiten saber que no existen diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los porcentajes históricos de protestantes y no protestantes indígenas. De hecho, el porcentaje que representan los indígenas sobre el total de manifestantes es cercano a solamente el 6% histórico desde 2006 a 2019. Esta baja cifra puede estar subestimada dado que no se realizan demasiadas encuestas en cantones rurales, donde la población indígena se concentra. Sin embargo, tiene sentido pensar que la cifra real no debería desviarse tanto de la que se presenta aquí: al ser los indígenas una minoría de la población del país3, es probable que también constituyen una minoría dentro de quienes participan en protestas. Por otro lado, sí existe una diferencia estadísticamente significativa en participacion en protestas respecto al porcentaje de gente que se autoidentifica como blanca, al ser menos probable que ellos protesten."

    "section": "Participación en protestas vs. apoyo al derecho de protesta",
    "text": "Participación en protestas vs. apoyo al derecho de protesta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViene al caso considerar una diferencia clave que pudo haber sido fácil de confundir últimamente, especialmente mientras las protestas tomaban lugar: la participación en protestas no es lo mismo que la aprobación a las mismas. El Barómetro de las Américas de LAPOP nos permite construir una serie de tiempo para monitorear el apoyo histórico a las protestas de los ecuatorianos, como se ve a continuación.\nLos datos nos muestran que, previo a la protesta del 2019, el derecho a protestar tanto en general como de grupos de oposición ha sido aprobado por la mayoría de la población en edad de votar, salvo en el 2012 y en el 2014. En un principio, más ecuatorianos apoyan las protestas en general que las protestas de los grupos en contra del gobierno actual4. Sin embargo, la relación se invierte para 2016, cerca del fin del gobierno de Correa, en donde era más probable que una persona apruebe las protestas contra el actual gobierno que las protestas en general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn hecho que salta a la vista es que el período de menor tolerancia a la protesta se dio durante el pico de popularidad del gobierno de Rafael Correa, como puede observarse en el gráfico de abajo. En períodos donde el presidente era popular, existía mayor rechazo hacia la protesta mientras que en períodos donde el presidente era menos popular había más aprobación hacia la protesta. Desde que Lenín Moreno se distanció del antiguo régimen, se vuelve a tener una mayor tolerancia a la protesta. No debemos inferir causalidad de correlación solamente, sin embargo, estos hechos abren la puerta a una posible explicación de protestas a conveniencia. Es decir, las protestas son válidas y legítimas cuando se alinean a mis intereses y tendencias políticas, pero si es que no… ¿no son válidas?\n\n\nTable 1: Aprobación al derecho a protestar por participación de los últimos 12 meses en protestas\n\n\n\n\n(a) Protestar en general\n\n\nHa participado en una protesta\nAprueba\nNo aprueba\n\n\n\n\nSí\n74%\n26%\n\n\nNo\n57%\n43%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Protestar en oposición al gobierno\n\n\nHa participado en una protesta\nAprueba\nNo aprueba\n\n\n\n\nSí\n62%\n38%\n\n\nNo\n55%\n45%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa tabla anterior nos muestra el porcentaje histórico de dos tipos de aprobación a las protestas clasificado por la participación en protestas. Como se esperaría, un protestante es más propenso a aprobar el derecho de protestar que alguien que no ha protestado. Sin embargo, también se esperaría que quienes participan en protestas aprueben ampliamente el derecho a protestar en cualquier ámbito, pero existe un 26% de ellos que no lo han aprobado históricamente. Respecto al apoyo a las protestas de los grupos de oposición al gobierno, los porcentajes son peores: históricamente un 38% de protestantes no aprueba ese derecho. Este es un fenómeno extraño y preocupante que merece ser observado más a fondo en el futuro, con datos actualizados."

    "section": "Algunas implicaciones",
    "text": "Algunas implicaciones\nEl análisis realizado se puede resumir en los siguientes puntos:\n\nLos protestantes tienden a aprobar el derecho a protestar (aunque no tanto), identificarse con algún ala política (derecha, izquierda o centro) y a desaprobar el trabajo del presidente. Es menos probable encontrar manifestantes mujeres y blancos.\nNo existen diferencias significativas entre protestantes y no protestantes en cuanto a edad, años de escolaridad, la probabilidad de ser indígena, estar desempleado y tener una peor situación económica.\nSe encuentra una clara divergencia entre la participación en protestas y la aprobación de las mismas, siendo siempre el porcentaje de aprobación mucho mayor al de participación.\nInquietantemente, la aprobación a las protestas se mueve en contra del apoyo al presidente de turno. Mientras más popular el gobierno, menos respetado el derecho a la protesta.\n\nEs necesario entender lo que implican las protestas, tanto para quienes las lideran y las enfrentan como para los ciudadanos comunes y corrientes. En mi opinión, es incluso más importante que el ecuatoriano promedio las comprenda, puesto que son ellos los que suelen estar en primera línea de las manifestaciones a diferencia de aquellos políticos, dirigentes y autoridades que las protagonizan. No es justificable la violencia del estado hacia la protesta social, así como la minimización de los problemas que aquejan a las comunidades índigenas5, pero la violencia por parte de protestantes tampoco puede justificarse. Informar nuestra discusión sobre la coyuntura del país con hechos, libres de ideología y subjetividad, es extremadamente imperante para encaminarnos hacia una mejor nación, evitando la violencia y polarización social así como protegiendo el derecho a la protesta pacífica, clave para el buen funcionamiento de una democracia [12].\nLas protestas de junio 2022 finalizan con concesiones de ambas partes, las cuales desafortunadamente solo giran alrededor del precio de la gasolina, postergando hacia el mediano plazo la resolución de los otros problemas como la obtención de precios justos para los productores agrícolas y el manejo de la crisis de inseguridad. La historia amenaza con repetirse en esta mesa de diálogo, recordando que en el 2019 las protestas finalizaron por una estabilización del precio de la gasolina aunque los actores involucrados fueron incapaces de llegar a un acuerdo [6]. Nuestro país no puede aguantar más violencia entre protestantes y autoridades cada dos años; los agentes sociales deben esforzarse para que el Ecuador sea justamente eso: un país, y no un licuador6 al que le entregas algo íntegro y te lo devuelve triturado. Debemos exigir al resto y exigirnos a nosotros mismos la fuerza para construir un país de paz y prosperidad, pero también un país de cambio pacífico y efectivo cuando lo apremie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota\n\n\n\nEste post fue orgullosamente concebido con Quarto y R mediante RStudio, originalmente publicado en El Quantificador del Laboratorio de Investigación para el Desarrollo del Ecuador (LIDE).

    "section": "Learning R",
    "text": "Learning R\nR through RStudio, one of my longtime friends. Here you will find a list of resources which I believe can help you get started on your adventures with this marvelous software. It should be noted that I am including these resources with a practical rather than technical approach, which might be a little biased toward econometrics, so it is possible that people on other fields find other resources more helpful.\n\nBook: R for Data Science (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund\n\nProbably the best introduction to the sofware that exists today. It has been endlessly recommended by all sorts of experts on R, and it is probably because it is a clear and practical guide on how to use R for all sorts of stuff (although the title says specifically data science I strongly believe this intro is fit for anybody who wants to use R). It will teach you what R is, what it isn’t and what it does best. It is a crash course on five major functions that the language has which are Wrangle, Program, Explore, Model and Communicate. However, because it is an introductory textbook, you’ll feel that it only scratches the surface on these three things. In my opinion the “wrangle” part is pretty comprehensive, but if you need more, you’ll have to go to other resources, specially for the “Communicate” part. The only difficulty you might find with this book is installing the software, but the next resource will help you with that.\n\nVideo series: Getting Started with R-Series I (and probably the rest of the channel) by Mike Marin & Ladan Hamadani\n\nA great tutorial series and overall a great YouTube channel, probably best for those that prefer learning by watching than by reading. Also, I believe that at least for installing a distribution of R and the RStudio IDE it is better to watch videos of other people doing so than reading it. The installation of the software might be one of the complications that R has compared to other software. The tutorial is done on a Mac, but as of right now I have not found that the installation process for a Windows computer is terribly different.\n-Website: R Tutorials: Basics by Simon Ejdemyr.\nA collection of written tutorials online. It might overlap with the resources that I am including here, however, this set of tutorials are a bit more technical and focus a bit more on Base R rather than the Tidyverse. Good to compliment your knowledge, and I know some of you out there prefer Base R to the Tidyverse.\n\nBook: Using R for Introductory Statistics by John Verzani\n\nA popular book which very clearly introduces R and simple statistics knowledge. I’ve seen it recommended consistently as a good guide if you feel you’ve understood R4DS but still feel unclear how to continue. Some good alternatives could be Exploratory Data Analysis with R, R in a Nutshell or the R Cookbook.\n\nWebsite: Usando los datos del Barómetro de las Américas by the Latin American Public Opinion Project\n\nIf you’re here from my GitHub repository and want to start using R to analyze the AmericasBarometer data, this is the tutorial for you. It will give you a very general overview of R and will teach you to do the more specific stuff needed to analyze the AmericasBarometer data. One of the most important things that this tutorial includes is the use of survey design objects of the survey package to produce survey-weighted results. Keep in mind it is written in Spanish, so if you can’t read Spanish and need help, don’t hesitate to contact me. Thomas Lumley’s Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R is the only book I’ve found which discusses the use of survey data on R, but I found the book fairly advanced, so I think this resource is the best thing there is as far as I know.\n\nBook: Hands-On Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund\n\nUnlike R4DS, this book is an intro to programming in R, “powerful R tools for solving data problems”, rather than doing the data analysis. Suffice to say this book will teach you about objects, functions, loops, and other programming concepts which are also seen in other programming languages. A great complement for R4DS, but maybe not as essential for beginners or people focused to use R for data analysis only.\n\nBook: Using R for Introductory Econometrics (URfIE) by Florian Heiss.\n\nThis is another amazing free book which walks you through the required R concepts, workflows, packages to master all examples and exercises in Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach by Jeffrey Wooldridge, but it also can serve as a standalone introduction to the R language and its applications for econometrics. It will serve as one of the most powerful weapons on an Economics student’s arsenal while in school, considering that I’ve often heard that in econometrics courses the software applications are often neglected. This book is considerably better for beginners compared to other classic books on regression and econometrics like An R Companion to Applied Regression and Applied Econometrics with R. It also has a sister textbook, Using Python for Introductory Econometrics for those interested in applying Python to econometrics as well.\n\nBook: The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality by Nick Huntington-Klein\n\nA great book which serves as an introduction to the concepts of causality and research design, which includes code on R, Stata and Python. This is the next step from URfIE for students of econometrics, as it is simple enough to not require complicated mathematics but it comprehensive enough to cover advanced econometric topics. It is very accesible and a pathway into more difficult econometrics books like Causal Inference: The Mixtape, Mastering ’Metrics or Mostly Harmless Econometrics. An alternative/complement to The Effect is Introduction to Econometrics with R by Hanck et al.\n\nWebsite: The Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST) by Nick Huntington-Klein et al\n\nA “Rosetta Stone” for statistical software. Think of it as a dictionary for statistical or data wrangling methods where you have definitions, explanations, but most importantly, you have code implementations for different statistical software, including but not limited to R, Python and Stata. Considering contributing to LOST if you can, there are still many things that are waiting to be done.\n\nBook: R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang\n\nA short but sweet introduction on how to produce almost any type of graph imaginable in R using the famous ggplot2 package. It also includes short introductions to R, the pipe operator %&gt;% and how to graph using base R. It is very useful as a quick desktop reference, however, it won’t actually teach you too much about the logic behind ggplot2, the grammar of graphics. For this, I’ll recommend the original piece by Leland Wilkinson and the book that introduces the ggplot2 package.\n\nBook: Dynamic Documents with R and knitr by Yihui Xie\n\nAt a certain point you’ll want to stop spitting code at the script window and start communicating the results of your analysis to other people, at least to your professor or TA for your homework assignments. While URfIE and Dr. Ejdmyr’s tutorials give you good advice on how to export results to your report or paper, the best way to communicate results is to be able to mix prose and code to produce dynamic documents on RStudio itself. Some of this is explained in R4DS and also in URfIE, but this book delves much, much deeper in all of this. This prose-code workflow is explained with marvelous detail in this book. It will introduce RMarkdown, but most importantly, it will introduce knitr/sweave and .Rnw files in the R context. The latter are files which incorporate LaTeX and R, something which is very powerful and almost indispensable when producing complex documents. Until this day, I have not found a better exposition of the LaTeX and R integration.\n\nBook: R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Yihui Xie, J.J. Allaire and Garret Grolemund\n\nAlthough LaTeX is more powerful than RMarkdown, it does have a steeper learning curve. Besides, RMarkdown allows you to do a lot of interesting stuff, like publishing webpages using blogdown, Quarto, publishing to RPubs, outputting to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint1 among others. This book discusses the use of RMarkdown document generation from beginning to end. A more practical approach, similar to Chang’s book on ggplot2 can be found on RMarkdown Cookbook.\nHowever, in my personal opinion RMarkdown still makes it too difficult to format long, complex documents with strict formatting guidelines. RMarkdown might not give you enough power to do complex stuff, although I have heard that the thesisdown and bookdown packages may give you more power to do this while keeping RMarkdown syntax. I think that if you’ve reached the point where RMarkdown feels too simple for you, you will be better off in the long run learning LaTeX and compiling your documents using .Rnw files as described in the Dynamic Docs books, however, do as you like, de gustibus non est disputandum.\n\nWebsite: R Style Guide by Jean Fan, et al\n\nIn order to produce research that can be easily reproduced, code that is written clearly and in an ordered manner is necessary. This might be trickier than it sounds, but this resource carefully and concisely presents some coding style guidelines to ensure that the R code you write can be understood by other people. The authors also provide us with other style guides, even one by Hadley Wickham.\n\nBook (or website?) Happy Git and Github for the useR by Jenny Bryan\n\nA crystal-clear introduction to project version control with Git and GitHub. Version control, although a simple premise, has a somewhat difficult implementation with R and in general with anything that is not Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This book offers a very clear introduction to this with a practical approach aimed at complete beginners.\n\nDocument(s): Cheatsheets\n\nMany people might not have time to look at a book, video tutorial or even their own previous work when trying to do some task in R. This is what Cheatsheets are for: quick reference guides which work best when you already know the concepts and just need a refresher. A good one is Tom Short’s R Reference Card but there are tons of Cheatsheets out there. RStudio provides you with quick access to some of these by clicking Help -&gt; Cheat Sheets.\n\nDocument(s): Manuals\n\nThis wouldn’t be a complete resource list if I didn’t include the actual manuals which can be found here. However, I do believe these are quite technical, even when considering the complete beginner’s manual/book R for Beginners by Emmanuel Paradis. Complete beginners might find them difficult to understand, but I’ve realized that when facing difficult issues with no apparent solution it is good to carefully read the documentation, or to ask on Stack Overflow. The most recommended ones are R Installation and Administration and An Introduction to R. These are the manuals for the R language, but chances are that if you’re stuck, is because you’re stuck on the usage of a package, so you must consult that package’s documentation, which can be found on CRAN.\n\nWebsite/Book: The Book of R\n\nAn absolutely amazing compilation of applied R books that come into contact and are selected by the author. If you’re looking for a book that especifically discusses a specialized topic you need to work on and you’ve already learned the basics of the language, look it up on the Big Book. There’s even a book on R Programming with Minecraft. You can help the author include more books by filling out his Google Forms survey.\nThere are some field-specific books/websites which I think are interesting that haven’t been included to the Big Book yet, which I’ll include below. These might be included in the future, as I will ask Oscar to add them.\n\nLab Guide to Quantitative Research Methods in Political Science, Public Policy & Public Administration\nProgram Evaluation for Public Service2\nstat545.com3\nR Through Excel\nText Analysis with R for Students of Literature\nFinancial, Macro and Micro Econometrics Using R\nQuantitative Economics with R\n\nBelow I will include some resources that I haven’t exactly read, but I’ve repeatedly heard that they are important for improving your R skills after picking up the basics:\n\nThe Art of R Programming\nAdvanced R\nR Inferno\nR Packages"

    "text": "Some extra advice\nWorking with R throughout my life as a student and for my personal project, I’ve met with endless issues. I’ve been able to solve most of them by googling my question and reading other people’s Stack Overflow’s questions, or reading books. However, there have been complicated problems which have had rather difficult solutions. In this section I’d like to give some unsolicited advice for you to not run into these problems or how to solve them efficiently if you do.\n\nOn building descriptive statistic and regression tables\nThe stargazer package is one of the most time-efficient ways of constructing summary tables in R. You only need to install and load the package into your file, then use the stargazer() function with a data frame or model object. With data, it can print a fairly decent descriptive statistics table. There are additional ways to customize the function’s output (remember you can use ? before the function’s call to see the function’s documentation on RStudio’s Help pane). It can print side-by-side regressions tables by feeding a list of regressions to the functions too. The package can output the tables to LaTeX, html or text. The stargazer() function is also compatible with many different types of model objects.\nHowever, this package is not the ultimate solution for building regression tables. It quickly becomes clumsy when trying to add special types of standard errors to your estimated model coefficients, when you’re trying to add new goodness-of-fit statistics, etc. I’ve also found out that it does not work too well when used with .Rnw and .Rmd files. Below, I will talk about the great package modelsummary, however, I still believe that stargazer is a good alternative when you’re starting out, for quickly visualizing models and descriptive statistics for your data.\nmodelsummary is the ultimate alternative to stargazer. I used this package extensively in my undergraduate capstone project and found it to be amazing. It can support virtually all R model objects and allows endless customizations for your tables. One amazing feature is that you can pass arguments to the modelsummary function which work with the kable package, which are particularly useful for complex tables. One example is the longtable = T argument, which isn’t a built-in argument of modelsummary, but it is an argument for the kable package. Also, this package works perfectly with .Rnw and .Rmd files. modelsummary is very, very recommended and will probably save you time in the long run if you start using this one instead of stargazer when you start to create tables from R output. If you want guidance on how to use the package, you can check out all the vignettes made by the package author and the way that I used the package in my papers, all available in my GitHub profile.\n\n\nSurvey data and binary-outcome models\nDuring the data analysis for my capstone project, I worked extensively with survey data and eventually got to running binary-outcome models, namely logit and probit models, with the data. In the literature that used the datasets I was using, it was standard practice to run survey-weighted models to get complex sample-adjusted standard errors and adjusted coefficients. I had no trouble doing this using the survey package in R, however, I ran into trouble when I wanted to calculate average partial effects- it was impossible to do so with both the margins() or the marginaleffects() functions (both have their package named after themselves.).\nAfter much asking around and reading documentation, I found two solutions. The first one is complex and clunky, and not so effective, but it works. The whole thing is described in this Stack Overflow question that I made when I became desperate one time at 3 am.\nThe second solution is the one that definitely solved the issue and I discovered it only recently. It is possible to calculate average partial effects of the models that had given me issues in the past when I changed the data type of certain variables. Since I had imported my data from Stata files (.dat files) using the haven package, when I ran class() on certain variables I found that it had double as the data type. I found that changing the data type to integer or numeric using the as.* functions solved the issue, now, running marginaleffects() on the model objects with the updated variables caused no issues. A certainly strange problem; I might write about it on the Posts section and/or contribute to LOST with this info."
